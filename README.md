# blockchain implementation
 this is a project i worked on during Discovery grad hack hackathon, it is a way for the company to increase speed reliability and increase transperancy by not unsing traditional databases but instead use blockchain to make transactions...ie this blockchain is a beta version and does not include all properties of blockchain but includes all major properties(e.g transparency,transecting,smart contracts etc.))
